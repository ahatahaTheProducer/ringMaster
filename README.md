# ringMaster
with this c program we are just starting to understand the key process of parsing natural languages
in order to get more intuition about the project please read the documentation
there may be mistakes other than handling the exceptions (in this project i didn't get into details of exeption and error handling, my main idea is to comprehend the main idea)
so if you encounter any or if you have any other idea feel free to reach me

thanks :)
